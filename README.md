# Project 25 - Selfie Share

Days 83-84 of 100 Days Of Swift

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

## Topics

Day 83: Peer to peer networking, Collection View, and GCD.

## Challenges

Day 84:

1. Show an alert when a user has disconnected from our multipeer network. Something like “Paul’s iPhone has disconnected” is enough.
2. Try sending text messages across the network. You can create a Data from a string using Data(yourString.utf8), and convert a Data back to a string by using String(decoding: yourData, as: UTF8.self).
3. Add a button that shows an alert controller listing the names of all devices currently connected to the session – use the connectedPeers property of your session to find that information.
